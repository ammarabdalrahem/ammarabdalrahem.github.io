 I am someone who studied to become an engineer, am now a quantitative investment analyst by trade, who loves telling stories with data. This page is a collection of basic data explorations and analyses on whatever draws my attention at any given moment. </br>

 <p></p>

 Aside from data and investments, I also enjoy playing a myriad of guitars, watching every grade of horror movie, and dabbling in some ultimate frisbee and distance running.
