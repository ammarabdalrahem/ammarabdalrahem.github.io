<p><strong> Me: Clint Howard </strong></p>

I am a quantitative researcher with a focus on listed equities. I have particular interests in applied machine learning, portfolio construction, and empirical asset pricing. I'm currently working as a researcher for Robeco in Rotterdam, Netherlands, whilst completing my part-time PhD in quantitative finance.

Aside from investments, I also enjoy playing a myriad of guitars, watching every grade of horror movie, and dabbling in some ultimate frisbee. </br>
