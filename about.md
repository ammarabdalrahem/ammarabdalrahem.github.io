I am a quantitative portfolio manager with a focus on systematic equity strategies. I received my PhD from the University of Technology Sydney that I completed part time whilst working full time (I don't recommend this if you enjoy any semblance of life), where I focused on machine learning techniques in finance and the index effect. In my prior life, I studied chemical engineering and mathematics.

Aside from the research I do in my day job, I have wide and varied interests in portfolio construction/optimization, challenging established empirical results, and a soft spot for flow-based effects. Go [here](/research/) to read more.
