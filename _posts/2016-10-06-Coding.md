\begin{align}
\mbox{Union: } & A\cup B = \{x\mid x\in A \mbox{ or } x\in B\} \\
\mbox{Concatenation: } & A\circ B  = \{xy\mid x\in A \mbox{ and } y\in B\} \\
\mbox{Star: } & A^\star  = \{x_1x_2\ldots x_k \mid  k\geq 0 \mbox{ and each } x_i\in A\} \\
\end{align}

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
